# Background

This repository was created in support of a small Spring Data REST experiment that failed on establishing a link between two entities. It turned out to be a user error. See [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40659697/404-on-setting-an-association-resource) and [DATAREST-943](https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAREST-943) for background information.

The request in ``loadData.bat`` is corrected, so this repository can also be used as a Spring Data Rest example.
